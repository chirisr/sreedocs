Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring Overview
Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring simulates user interactions with applications to test performance, availability, and user experience proactively. It uses scripts to mimic real-world transactions from various global or private locations, enabling you to detect and resolve issues before they affect real users.

For an application running in OpenShift containers, it ensures that containerized workloads deliver consistent performance and reliability by testing critical paths, API endpoints, and user interactions.

Core Capabilities for Applications on OpenShift
Simulated User Transactions:

Simulate user actions like logging in, searching, or making API calls to test the app's responsiveness and reliability.
Performance Monitoring:

Measure key metrics such as response times, throughput, and latency for applications hosted in OpenShift.
Availability Testing:

Test the uptime of services, APIs, or web endpoints running on OpenShift containers.
Root Cause Analysis:

Correlate synthetic monitoring data with Dynatrace's full-stack insights, tracing issues to specific services or containerized components (e.g., overloaded pods or misconfigured brokers).
Global and Private Monitoring Locations:

Test the application from global Dynatrace locations or private locations within your OpenShift cluster to simulate internal and external traffic.
Service Dependency Tracking:

Map interactions between your application and its dependencies (e.g., Kafka, databases) to identify bottlenecks in the pipeline.
Real-Time Alerts:

Set thresholds for key metrics (e.g., response times, API failures) and get alerts for potential issues.
End-to-End Monitoring:

Monitor entire workflows, such as data processing in a Kafka-based app, from producer to consumer, ensuring smooth operation of containerized microservices.
Types of Synthetic Monitoring
Browser Clickpaths:

Simulate a user navigating through the application UI using automated browser tests.
Example: Test the flow of a user placing an order in an e-commerce app running on OpenShift.
HTTP Monitors:

Test individual API endpoints or web services for availability and response times.
Example: Monitor REST APIs exposed by an OpenShift-hosted Kafka producer for message ingestion.
Browser Monitors:

Measure performance of single-page applications by loading web pages in a browser environment.
Example: Test the load time of a dashboard UI hosted in OpenShift.
Custom Monitors:

Run tailored synthetic tests to simulate unique workflows or transactions.
Example: Simulate a Kafka consumer polling for messages from a topic and verify response times.
Use Case Example for OpenShift: Kafka Application
Simulate a Kafka producer sending messages to a topic hosted in OpenShift and verify response times.
Monitor API endpoints used for publishing and consuming messages.
Test the UI of a real-time analytics dashboard that consumes Kafka data, ensuring it loads within acceptable thresholds globally.
By combining synthetic tests with Dynatraceâ€™s full-stack insights, you gain end-to-end visibility into applications running on OpenShift containers, ensuring optimal performance and user satisfaction.
