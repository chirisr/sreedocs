Dear [Splunk Team/Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out regarding an issue we have observed with the events being ingested into Splunk, which appear to be incomplete in certain scenarios.

Observations:
At the application level, logs are being written correctly, and all start and end events are present in the raw application logs.
When the same logs are piped into Splunk, some events appear to be missing. Specifically:
Some events are missing the start message but have an end message.
Some events have the start message but no corresponding end message.
A significant number of events are complete (both start and end are present).
These discrepancies have been verified by comparing the application-level logs and the data visible in Splunk.

Example:
For a given correlation ID (<example_correlation_id>):

Application log shows both "request received" and "message published successfully".
Splunk only displays "message published successfully".
This behavior suggests that the issue may lie in the data pipeline between the application and Splunk.

Questions for Investigation:
Are there any known limitations or issues in the Splunk ingestion pipeline (e.g., heavy forwarders, indexers, or universal forwarders) that could result in the loss of events?
Could this be caused by a configuration issue in the Splunk forwarder or ingestion pipeline, such as:
Maximum event size (maxEventSize) restrictions?
Line breaking or merging rules (LINE_BREAKER, SHOULD_LINEMERGE)?
Is there a chance that network issues or buffering settings (e.g., queueSize) are causing logs to be dropped or overwritten during high traffic?
Are there any rate-limiting or ingestion throttling policies that might result in partial data ingestion?
Could there be an issue with how the logs are being parsed, resulting in certain events being dropped due to format mismatches?
Supporting Details:
Index/Sourcetype: <provide details>
Environment: <e.g., Development, Test, UAT>
Log Sample:
plaintext
Copy code
[Timestamp] [Pod] request received for correlation_id=<ID>
[Timestamp] [Pod] message published successfully for correlation_id=<ID>
Steps Taken to Validate:
Compared raw logs at the application level with ingested logs in Splunk.
Verified that the issue is consistent across multiple correlation IDs.
Observed that the application logs have no missing data.
Request:
Could you please help investigate this issue or provide guidance on the possible causes and remediation steps? We would appreciate any insights or checks we can perform to identify the root cause.

Looking forward to your response.
