What is SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)?
Protocol: XML-based

Use case: Legacy or enterprise SSO

Flow: Browser is redirected to Identity Provider (IdP), user logs in, and is redirected back with a signed assertion.

Popular IdPs: PingFederate, ADFS, Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin

Attributes: Often passes email, name, roles, etc.

Pros:

Widely supported in enterprise environments

Strong integration with traditional IdPs like PingFederate

Mature and secure

Cons:

XML-based and harder to debug

Browser-based (no native mobile support)

ðŸªª What is OpenID Connect (OIDC)?
Protocol: Modern OAuth 2.0 + JSON-based authentication layer

Use case: Cloud-native SSO, mobile, and modern web apps

Flow: Redirects with token exchange via OAuth

Popular IdPs: Azure AD, Google, Okta, Auth0

Pros:

JSON-based (easier to handle)

Better support for APIs and SPAs

Works with mobile apps and modern web tech

Simpler integration in many cases

Cons:

Slightly newer, not all enterprise IdPs support it fully

What is HTTP Authentication Proxy?
Mechanism: You put a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Envoy) in front of Sourcegraph that handles authentication.

Example: Sourcegraph reads the user identity from a custom HTTP header (like X-Forwarded-User) set by your proxy.

Pros:

Simple if you already have a proxy (e.g., with LDAP or Kerberos)

Offloads authentication entirely from Sourcegraph

Cons:

Can be insecure if not configured correctly (must restrict headers)

Less flexible than SAML/OIDC

Harder to scale securely

Which Should You Choose for SSO with Sourcegraph?
Feature	SAML	OIDC	HTTP Auth Proxy
Modern, easy to integrate	XML	JSON Custom setup
Mobile/API support	No	Yes	No
Enterprise compatibility	Yes	Mostly	âš Depends
PingSSO (PingFederate)	Preferred	Only if supported	Not typical
Recommended for Sourcegraph	Yes (for PingSSO)	Yes (modern IdPs)	Only if required

Recommendation (based on using PingSSO)
Use SAML if:

You are using PingFederate or PingOne as your IdP

You need enterprise-grade SSO and you're okay with the XML complexity

You want to use Sourcegraphâ€™s native support for SAML-based auth

Use OIDC if:

Your IdP supports OIDC (e.g., Azure AD, Okta)

You prefer a simpler, modern setup

You may expand to mobile apps, APIs, or other OAuth-based tools

Use HTTP Proxy if:

You already have an enterprise auth proxy in place (e.g., NGINX+Kerberos)

You donâ€™t want Sourcegraph to handle auth directly

Let me know if you want help with choosing based on your infra or want a config sample for one of these options.
