Delete Vulnerable Images:

Check a CSV file with vulnerable image references.
Identify the associated registry, OpenShift clusters, and DeploymentConfigs using these images.
Remove the images from the registry and related objects in OpenShift, including DeploymentConfigs, Pods, and namespaces.
Namespace Level:

Check within a specific namespace and remove any vulnerable image in the registry associated with a running pod.
Cluster Level:

Execute the cleanup on a cluster-wide level for all namespaces with vulnerable images.
Cross-Cluster Level:

The design should be reusable and capable of performing cleanup across multiple OpenShift clusters.
Process Flow:

Identify vulnerable images listed in the CSV file.
Find all DeploymentConfigs using these images.
Delete the vulnerable images from the registry.
Delete or recreate DeploymentConfigs that depend on the vulnerable images.
Ensure cleanup across multiple clusters, namespaces, and DeploymentConfigs.
Steps for LLD:
1. Input (CSV with vulnerable image list):
The CSV file will contain information about the vulnerable images. Example columns:

image_name
version
namespace
2. Processing the Image Cleanup:
Namespace-Level Cleanup: Loop through each namespace and check for pods, deployments, and configurations using the vulnerable image.
Cluster-Level Cleanup: Check all namespaces within a given OpenShift cluster for deployments using vulnerable images.
Cross-Cluster Cleanup: If your deployment spans multiple clusters, create a cross-cluster solution that queries the image usage and performs the cleanup on each cluster.
3. Delete Vulnerable Images:
Use Kubernetes and OpenShift APIs to list the resources (pods, deployments, and services) using the vulnerable image.
Delete these resources (pods, deployments) that are running the vulnerable image.
Delete or mark the vulnerable image in the registry as obsolete.
Python Code (FastAPI-based solution)
Here is a Python solution using FastAPI, Pandas for CSV handling, and the OpenShift and Kubernetes Python Client to interact with OpenShift clusters.

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, UploadFile, File, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel, SecretStr
import pandas as pd
import io
import kubernetes
from openshift.dynamic import DynamicClient
import requests
import os

# FastAPI setup
app = FastAPI()

# Define a model for the authentication credentials
class AuthCredentials(BaseModel):
    api_token: SecretStr
    cluster_url: str

# Function to connect to OpenShift cluster using credentials
def get_openshift_client(auth: AuthCredentials):
    k8s_client = kubernetes.config.new_client_from_config()  # Assuming kubeconfig is set
    openshift_client = DynamicClient(k8s_client)
    return openshift_client

# CSV parsing and cleanup logic
def clean_vulnerable_images(csv_file: UploadFile):
    content = csv_file.file.read()
    df = pd.read_csv(io.BytesIO(content))
    
    # Assuming the CSV has 'image_name' and 'namespace' columns
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        image_name = row['image_name']
        namespace = row['namespace']
        
        # Query OpenShift/Kubernetes for deployments using this image
        print(f"Cleaning {image_name} in namespace {namespace}")
        
        # Call functions to clean the images, deployments, and related resources here
        # You can use OpenShift APIs to delete DeploymentConfig and other resources
        
        # Pseudo code: Cleanup vulnerable images in the specified namespace
        # cleanup_deployment(namespace, image_name)
        # delete_from_registry(image_name)

# Endpoint to handle CSV upload and process the cleanup
@app.post("/cleanup_vulnerable_images/")
async def cleanup_vulnerable_images(csv_file: UploadFile = File(...), auth: AuthCredentials = Depends()):
    try:
        openshift_client = get_openshift_client(auth)
        clean_vulnerable_images(csv_file)
        return {"message": "Vulnerable images cleanup initiated."}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")

# Example helper functions for OpenShift cleanup
def cleanup_deployment(namespace: str, image_name: str):
    # Logic to find DeploymentConfigs and Pods using the vulnerable image
    # For example, delete the DeploymentConfig in the namespace
    pass

def delete_from_registry(image_name: str):
    # Logic to delete the vulnerable image from the registry
    pass

# Command to run FastAPI
# uvicorn myapp:app --reload
How it works:
FastAPI accepts a CSV file with a list of vulnerable images and authentication credentials.
The script processes the CSV file, iterates over each row (image and namespace), and cleans up all resources in OpenShift using the vulnerable image.
OpenShift clients (DynamicClient) interact with clusters to find resources using the vulnerable image and clean them up.
Extending the Design for Multiple Clusters
You can extend this by adding logic to interact with multiple OpenShift clusters, especially if your deployments span across different clusters. You'll need to iterate through a list of clusters, get the OpenShift client for each, and clean them up as needed.
Usability for Other Teams:
You can package this as an API, which any other team can use. The API accepts a CSV with vulnerable images and cluster details and can trigger the cleanup process.
The reusable design ensures other teams can deploy this solution and run cleanup actions in their own clusters and namespaces.
