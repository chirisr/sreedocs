PaaS Comparison
Feature/Aspect	Heroku	AWS Elastic Beanstalk	Google App Engine	Use in Internal Cloud (OpenShift etc.)
Type	Full PaaS	PaaS wrapper over AWS infrastructure	Fully managed PaaS	Self-managed or vendor-hosted (not PaaS)
Vendor Lock-in	High	Moderate	High	Low (if OpenShift is self-hosted)
Supports Internal Cloud?	❌ No	❌ No	❌ No	✅ Yes
Infrastructure Control	None (fully abstracted)	Some (can tweak EC2, VPC, etc.)	None	Full
Custom Buildpacks/Docker	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
CI/CD Integration	Built-in (Git Push)	Uses CodePipeline, Jenkins, etc.	Google Cloud Build	Custom (Jenkins, Tekton, ArgoCD)
Autoscaling	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes (via OpenShift HPA)
Observability/Monitoring	Basic logs/dashboards	CloudWatch, X-Ray, etc.	Stackdriver	Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, etc.
Deployment Complexity	Very Simple (Git push)	Moderate	Simple	Medium (requires container & YAML setup)
Pricing	Freemium + tiered plans	Pay-as-you-go AWS model	Pay-as-you-go GCP model	Varies (Infra + Licensing if using OCP)
Terraform Support	✅ Manage apps (Heroku provider)	✅ Full AWS infrastructure	✅ GCP infrastructure	✅ Fully supported
Main Use Case	Fast app prototyping, startups	Web apps with some AWS control	Scalable apps for GCP environments	Enterprises, regulated industries

🚫 Why These Don’t Work in Internal Cloud
❌ Heroku in Internal Cloud?
Heroku is hosted and managed by Salesforce.

No on-premises installation or private cloud version is available.

Only way to mimic it is by using open-source alternatives like Dokku or Deis (deprecated).

❌ AWS Elastic Beanstalk in Internal Cloud?
It is tightly integrated with AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch).

It’s not installable on your own infrastructure.

Closest you can get is using OpenShift with Jenkins/Tekton pipelines, mimicking Beanstalk’s automation.

❌ Google App Engine in Internal Cloud?
GAE is proprietary to Google Cloud.

It depends on GCP’s infrastructure, APIs, and deployment mechanisms.

No private or offline version exists.

✅ What You Can Use as PaaS in Internal Cloud
Option	Description
OpenShift (Red Hat)	Kubernetes-based PaaS-like platform you can deploy on your internal infra
Cloud Foundry	True PaaS system for on-prem/cloud deployments
Rancher / K3s	Lightweight Kubernetes distributions with some PaaS abstractions
DIY GitOps with ArgoCD	Build your own PaaS-like experience using CI/CD, container registries, etc.

🔧 When to Use What?
Scenario	Best Option
Rapid prototyping / startups	Heroku
Existing AWS workloads	AWS Elastic Beanstalk
GCP-native development	Google App Engine
Enterprise on-prem / internal data centers	OpenShift, Cloud Foundry
Regulated industries (banking, healthcare)	OpenShift with compliance add-ons
Full Infra-as-Code control required	Terraform + OpenShift or K8s

✅ Final Recommendation for Internal Cloud
If you're working in a banking or enterprise setup with an internal OpenShift cluster, your best option is to:

Use OpenShift as a PaaS platform.

Integrate CI/CD tools like Jenkins or Tekton.

Add GitOps support with ArgoCD.

Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.
