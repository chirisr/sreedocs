1. Instrumentation and Metric Exposure
Main Application and Sidecar Container:

Both the main application and the sidecar container are instrumented to expose Prometheus metrics. These metrics can be anything from memory usage, CPU usage, request latency, etc.
The metrics are exposed via HTTP endpoints that Prometheus can scrape.
2. Prometheus Scrapes Metrics
Prometheus Configuration:

Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from the main application and sidecar container endpoints. This configuration is typically defined in a separate Prometheus configuration file, but here it’s implied that Prometheus is set up to discover and scrape the pods.
3. PrometheusRule Definition
Alerting Rules:

The PrometheusRule resource defines several alerting rules based on the container-level metrics.
Example Alerts:
HighMemoryUsageMainApp: Triggers if container_memory_usage_bytes for the main-app container exceeds 500MB for more than 5 minutes.
HighCpuUsageMainApp: Triggers if the CPU usage rate (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[1m])) for the main-app container exceeds 80% for more than 5 minutes.
HighMemoryUsageSidecar: Triggers if container_memory_usage_bytes for the sidecar container exceeds 200MB for more than 5 minutes.
HighCpuUsageSidecar: Triggers if the CPU usage rate (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[1m])) for the sidecar container exceeds 50% for more than 5 minutes.
Rule Execution:

Prometheus continuously evaluates these rules at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
If any rule’s condition is met for the specified duration (for: 5m), Prometheus triggers an alert.
4. Alertmanager Configuration
Alertmanager Setup:

The ConfigMap defines the Alertmanager configuration with email alert settings:
SMTP Configuration: Specifies the SMTP server, sender email, and authentication details.
Routing Configuration: Routes all alerts to the email-alert receiver.
Receiver Configuration: Defines an email receiver that sends alerts to your-email@example.com.
5. Alert Flow Execution
Flow Overview:

Metric Scraping: Prometheus scrapes metrics from the main application and sidecar container.
Rule Evaluation: Prometheus evaluates the defined rules against the scraped metrics.
Alert Triggering: If a rule’s condition is met (e.g., high memory usage), Prometheus triggers an alert.
Alert Dispatching: Prometheus sends the alert to Alertmanager.
Email Notification: Alertmanager processes the alert according to its routing configuration and sends an email notification to the specified recipient.
Execution Flow Example
Metric Collection:

Prometheus scrapes the container_memory_usage_bytes metric from the main-app container and finds that it is consistently above 500MB.
Rule Evaluation:

The HighMemoryUsageMainApp rule condition container_memory_usage_bytes{container="main-app"} > 500000000 is met.
Prometheus waits for the condition to be true for the specified duration (for: 5m).
Alert Triggering:

After 5 minutes of high memory usage, Prometheus triggers the HighMemoryUsageMainApp alert.
Alert Dispatching:

The alert is sent to Alertmanager.
Email Notification:

Alertmanager routes the alert to the email-alert receiver.
Alertmanager sends an email to your-email@example.com with details about the high memory usage in the main-app container.
