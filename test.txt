1. Deliverables & Project Execution

Successfully implemented Cert-Manager for the KUBES application, including certificate issuance, renewal automation, and cluster-level configuration.

Developed a Python-based utility to clean up stale container images, improving registry hygiene and reducing storage usage.

Packaged and deployed the utility as an OpenShift container, enabling continuous cleanup and operational efficiency.

Led the end-to-end implementation of Sourcegraph, including:

Proof of Concept (PoC) evaluation

Architecture design & sizing

Installation, configuration & environment hardening

Documentation and handover for application teams

Built and stabilized Dev and QA environments for Sourcegraph, ensuring scalability, security, and production readiness.

2. Quality Engineering & Reliability

Ensured high-quality deployments through automated testing, logging, and monitoring integrations.

Introduced cleanup automation via Python, reducing manual effort and eliminating human error.

Improved Sourcegraph search relevance and performance through:

Indexing optimizations

Repository auto-sync tuning

Search configuration enhancements

3. Value Creation & Impact

Enabled organization-wide faster code search and onboarding by deploying Sourcegraph, directly improving developer productivity.

Reduced registry storage costs and improved reliability with the automated stale image cleanup solution.

Improved enterprise security posture by implementing SSO authentication (SAML/OIDC/LDAP) and RBAC for Sourcegraph access control.

Strengthened collaboration with application teams by leading deployment activities and providing technical consulting during integration.

4. Open Source & DevOps Mindset

Embraced open-source tooling (Cert-Manager, Sourcegraph, Kubernetes, OpenShift) to modernize workflows and reduce vendor lock-in.
