2. Redirect Logs to Persistent Storage
Configure your application to write logs to a mounted persistent volume instead of default stdout/stderr. In your deployment configuration:

Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
Mount the PVC to a directory where your application writes its logs.
This ensures logs are stored even if the container is restarted.

3. Enable Cluster-Level Logging with OpenShift Logging
Deploy a centralized logging solution such as OpenShift Logging (EFK stack):

Elasticsearch: Stores logs for searching and visualization.
Fluentd: Collects logs from all containers and forwards them to Elasticsearch.
Kibana: Visualizes logs stored in Elasticsearch.
By enabling OpenShift Logging, logs from all containers in the cluster can be retained for a configurable period.

4. Use External Logging Solutions
Integrate your application with external logging systems such as:

Splunk: Forward logs using a sidecar container or Fluentd/Logstash.
Loggly, Datadog, or other logging-as-a-service platforms.
Use a log aggregation agent (e.g., Fluentd or Filebeat) to push logs to these systems.
5. Use a Sidecar Container for Log Management
Run a sidecar container alongside your application that reads the logs from the container and forwards them to an external logging system or persistent storage.

For example:

Mount the /var/log/containers directory from the host into the sidecar container.
Use Fluentd, Logstash, or another tool to process and forward logs.
6. Verify OpenShift Log Rotation Settings
OpenShift uses log rotation by default. You can modify the settings to increase the retention duration and size:

For Kubernetes/OpenShift native logging, adjust log-rotation-size and log-rotation-max-files.

  containers:
  - name: app
    image: my-app:latest
    env:
    - name: LOG_OPTS
      value: "--log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=5"
