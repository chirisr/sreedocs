Recommended Monitoring & Observability Approach for Sourcegraph in OpenShift
To monitor Sourcegraph effectively in an OpenShift environment, you should use a multi-layer observability strategy. This includes metrics, logs, traces, and optionally, application-level instrumentation. Below is a layered and practical approach tailored to Sourcegraph's architecture and typical enterprise security/compliance constraints.

 1. Built-in Sourcegraph Observability
Sourcegraph exposes internal metrics and logs via:

 a. Prometheus Metrics
Sourcegraph services (like frontend, gitserver, searcher, zoekt, etc.) expose Prometheus metrics at /metrics.

You can deploy Prometheus Operator in OpenShift and scrape metrics using ServiceMonitor resources.

Example endpoint:

php-template
Copy
Edit
http://<sourcegraph-service>:<port>/metrics
 b. Grafana Dashboards
Sourcegraph provides prebuilt dashboards:

Code intelligence latency

Search performance

Repository cloning

Gitserver queue times

You can import dashboards from Sourcegraphâ€™s GitHub: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/monitoring

2. Cluster-Level Monitoring via OpenShift Prometheus
OpenShift comes with Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana):

Monitor pod CPU, memory, restarts, disk usage

Integrate Sourcegraph services as targets for Prometheus scraping

Enable custom project monitoring:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  monitoring:
    enabled: true
Add ServiceMonitor:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: sourcegraph
  namespace: sourcegraph
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sourcegraph
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    path: /metrics
    interval: 30s
3. Log Aggregation (ELK / Loki / Splunk / Fluentd)
Centralized logging is crucial.

Options:
Tool	Integration
Fluentd / Fluent Bit	Ship logs to Elasticsearch or Splunk
Loki	Promtail reads pod logs and stores in Loki
OpenShift EFK stack	Use ClusterLogForwarder to route logs

Best Practice: Tag logs with namespace, pod, container, and env for Splunk or Kibana filtering.

4. Distributed Tracing (Optional / Advanced)
If needed, integrate tracing:

Tool	Compatibility
Jaeger / OpenTelemetry	Can be integrated with custom Sourcegraph builds
Dynatrace / New Relic / AppDynamics	Works if your containers allow agents or via service-level integration

Note: Sourcegraph does not come with native OpenTelemetry support for all services.

5. Dynatrace (Optional / Enterprise APM)
If using Dynatrace:

Use OneAgent Operator on OpenShift for infrastructure and container insights.

Avoid deep container injection unless Sourcegraph container base images allow it.

Dynatrace K8s dashboard + logs + infra + process monitoring is usually sufficient.

6. Alerting
Use Prometheus Alerts + Alertmanager or integrate with external systems:

Slack / Teams alerts

PagerDuty integration

CPU/memory usage

High response time or failed searches

Gitserver queue backlogs

7. Custom Dashboards
Use Grafana to create:

Repo clone success rate

Search latency trends

User activity

Gitserver disk queue
